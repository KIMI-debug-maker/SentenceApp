team with national luxury homes listing leader al lewis to break-into and sustain listing and sales success at the ""top"" of the market as either an associate or independent-affiliate of real estate professionals world enterprise marketing to list and sell (1) multi-million dollar custom homes (2) estates and (3) resort-oriented residences at any price-point and earn fees from 6% to 8% on each (no discounting).

we do not chase reos, short sales, nods or loan mods, nor do we chase court sales of any type or seek discount-oriented buyers; instead we seek high quality equity-positioned sellers (listings) at the top or high-end of the market, qualified high-end buyers and quick closings.

allstate luxury home sales / non-local, unbounded listing at the ""top"" or high-end of the market is a sure-fast way to grow your status and wealth through real estate. working at arm's length with broker al lewis in the field, in houses, listing in the high-end you will come to know firsthand by observation -- and the doing -- an easier, more pleasurable, more efficient way of getting and doing business at the top while, even, continuing your present work. the ""traditional"" broker/agent associate-licensee relationship is optional, but not required. an opportunity for ""affiliation"" while continuing to work independently or within a current broker/agent association is provided.

an individual, team or whole company can work with broker al lewis under broker's unique umbrella for cooperative listing at the top of the market -- the real estate fellowship -- and have new listings within thirty-days. leads, access, break-in strategies, portfolio, in-field/in-house support, and high-level marketing of homes listed (at broker's expense) provided.

go to www.therealestatefellowship.com for information.

""the idea behind the fellowship is that it is a two person (you and i) team-oriented apprenticeship to a work for both brokers and agents (known as marketing partners and/or protégés) and a retooling platform for lions and tigers, panthers and cheetahs (whether brokers or agents) that by cause or circumstance are not in an effective listing program at this time or, specifically, not geared up for professional high-end sales and marketing to the degree they would like to be."" al lewis

you can request a reasonable accommodation at any time during the application or hiring process or while on the job. requests are considered on a case-by-case basis.

class standing -- applicants must be in the upper third of the graduating class in the college, university, or major subdivision, such as the college of liberal arts or the school of business administration, based on completed courses.
grade-point average (g.p.a.)-- applicants must have a grade-point average of:

3.0 or higher out of a possible 4.0 (""b"" or better) as recorded on their official transcript, or as computed based on 4 years of education, or as computed based on courses completed during the final 2 years of the curriculum; or
3.5 or higher out of a possible 4.0 (""b+"" or better) based on the average of the required courses completed in the major field or the required courses in the major field completed during the final 2 years of the curriculum.

grade-point averages are to be rounded to one decimal place. for example, 2.95 will round to 3.0 and 2.94 will round to 2.9.

g.p.a. excluding pass/fail courses. applicants usually cannot claim credit based on their overall g.p.a. if more than 10 percent of their total credit was based on pass/fail or similar systems rather than on traditional grading systems. however, if they can document that only their freshman-year courses (25 percent or less of their total credit) were credited on a pass/fail or similar system, they can use their overall g.p.a. to claim superior academic achievement. if 10 percent or fewer credits or only freshman-year courses were based on pass/fail or similar systems, such credits can be ignored and the g.p.a. computed on the graded courses. applicants can, however, still claim credit based on their last 2 years if 10 percent or fewer credits were based on pass/fail or similar systems. applicants who cannot claim credit under the g.p.a. requirements may claim credit for superior academic achievement only on the basis of class standing or honor society membership.

election to membership in a national scholastic honor society -- applicants can be considered eligible based on membership in one of the national scholastic honor societies listed below. these honor societies are listed by the association of college honor societies. membership in a freshman honor society cannot be used to meet the requirements of this provision.

education substitution for the gs-09: 2 years of progressively higher level graduate education leading to a master's degree or master's or equivalent graduate degree.

foreign education: if you are using education completed in foreign colleges or universities to meet the qualification requirements, you must show that the education credentials have been evaluated by a private organization that specializes in interpretation of foreign education programs and such education has been deemed equivalent to that gained in an accredited u.s. education program; or full credit has been given for the courses at a u.s. accredited college or university. for more information about this requirement, please visit the u.s. department of education website for foreign education evaluation .

basic education requirement

a. degree: engineering. to be acceptable, the program must: (1) lead to a bachelor's degree in a school of engineering with at least one program accredited by abet; or (2) include differential and integral calculus and courses (more advanced than first-year physics and chemistry) in five of the following seven areas of engineering science or physics: (a) statics, dynamics; (b) strength of materials (stress-strain relationships); (c) fluid mechanics, hydraulics; (d) thermodynamics; (e) electrical fields and circuits; (f) nature and properties of materials (relating particle and aggregate structure to properties); and (g) any other comparable area of fundamental engineering science or physics, such as optics, heat transfer, soil mechanics, or electronics.
or
b. combination of education and experience -- college-level education, training, and/or technical experience that furnished (1) a thorough knowledge of the physical and mathematical sciences underlying engineering, and (2) a good understanding, both theoretical and practical, of the engineering sciences and techniques and their applications to one of the branches of engineering. the adequacy of such background must be demonstrated by one of the following:

professional registration or licensure -- current registration as an engineer intern (ei), engineer in training (eit), or licensure as a professional engineer (pe) by any state, the district of columbia, guam, or puerto rico. absent other means of qualifying under this standard, those applicants who achieved such registration by means other than written test (e.g., state grandfather or eminence provisions) are eligible only for positions that are within or closely related to the specialty field of their registration. for example, an applicant who attains registration through a state board's eminence provision as a manufacturing engineer typically would be rated eligible only for manufacturing engineering positions.

written test -- evidence of having successfully passed the fundamentals of engineering (fe) examination or any other written test required for professional registration by an engineering licensure board in the various states, the district of columbia, guam, and puerto rico.

specified academic courses -- successful completion of at least 60 semester hours of courses in the physical, mathematical, and engineering sciences and that included the courses specified in the basic requirements under paragraph a. the courses must be fully acceptable toward meeting the requirements of an engineering program as described in paragraph a.

related curriculum -- successful completion of a curriculum leading to a bachelor's degree in engineering technology or in an appropriate professional field, e.g., physics, chemistry, architecture, computer science, mathematics, hydrology, or geology, may be accepted in lieu of a degree in engineering, provided the applicant has had at least 1 year of professional engineering experience acquired under professional engineering supervision and guidance.

note: you must provide a letter of reference stating that you have at least 1 year of professional engineering experience acquired under professional engineering supervision and guidance. the letter must be signed by the engineer who provided the professional engineer supervision. it must also include their name, phone number, and engineer credentials (i.e. engineer education or professional certificates). lack of this documentation will make you ineligible to be referred.

note: an applicant who meets the basic requirements as specified in a or b above, except as noted under b.1., may qualify for positions in any branch of engineering unless selective factors indicate otherwise.

qualifications

to qualify for a quality assurance specialist your resume and supporting documentation must support:

a. specialized experience: one year of specialized experience that equipped you with the particular competencies to successfully perform the duties of the position, and that is typically in or related to the position to be filled. to qualify at the gs-09 level, applicants must possess one year of specialized experience equivalent to the gs-07 level or equivalent under other pay systems in the federal service, military or private sector. to qualify at the gs-11 level, applicants must possess one year of specialized experience equivalent to the gs-09 level or equivalent under other pay systems in the federal service, military or private sector. creditable specialized experience includes:

gs-09:
* applying established techniques, regulations and requirements related to a quality assurance functional program to a variety of assignments.
* interpreting, explaining, and applying technical requirements and specifications to quality assurance problems.
* developing, analyzing, and evaluating facts relative to unsatisfactory conditions or trends and preparing reports to document findings.
* assisting in developing product assurance plans designed to insure effective control of product quality.
* reviewing the contractor's production activities and capabilities in light of contract quality requirements.
gs-11:
* reviewing production activities/capabilities for compliance to contract quality requirements.
* reviewing written technical, quality, and/or inspection procedures for adequacy, and evaluating the implementation and effectiveness of quality/inspection criteria, including sampling plans.
* analyzing technical and quality data to detect unsatisfactory trends or weaknesses in material quality.
* verifying by test or inspection, using sampling inspection or intensive product inspection techniques, that products comply with requirements prior to acceptance.
* computing data, summarizing **results**, and preparing reports or charts depicting pertinent relationships using statistical methods.

b. education substitution: such education must demonstrate the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to do the work. education must be from a college or university accredited by an organization approved by the u.s. department of education. see http://ope.ed.gov/accreditation/search.aspx. if using education to meet basic qualifications, you must submit a transcript as supplemental documentation. to qualify based on education in lieu of specialized experience, you must possess:

gs-09:
* master's or equivalent graduate degree or 2 full years of progressively higher level graduate education leading to such a degree or ll.b. or j.d., if related.
gs-11:
* ph.d. or equivalent doctoral degree or 3 full years of progressively higher level graduate education leading to such a degree or ll.m., if related.
c. combination: combinations of successfully completed post-high school education and experience may be used to meet total qualification requirements for grade levels gs-09 and gs-11, and may be computed by first determining the applicant's total qualifying experience as a percentage of the experience required for the grade level; then determining the applicant's education as a percentage of the education required for the grade level; and then adding the two percentages. the total percentages must equal at least 100 percent to qualify an applicant for that grade level. only graduate education in excess of the amount required for the next lower grade level may be used to qualify applicants for positions at grade gs-09 and gs-11.

experience refers to paid and unpaid experience, including volunteer work done through national service programs (e.g., peace corps, americorps) and other organizations (e.g., professional; philanthropic; religious; spiritual; community, student, social). volunteer work helps build critical competencies, knowledge, and skills and can provide valuable training and experience that translates directly to paid employment. you will receive credit for all qualifying experience, including volunteer experience.

education

are you using your education to qualify? you must provide transcripts or other documentation to support your educational claims. unless otherwise stated: unofficial transcripts are acceptable at time of application.

graduate education: one academic year of graduate education is considered to be the number of credits hours that your graduate school has determined to represent one academic year of full-time study. such study may have been performed on a full-time or part-time basis. if you cannot obtain your graduate school's definition of one year of graduate study, 18 semester hours (or 27 quarter hours) should be considered as satisfying the requirement for one year of full-time graduate study.

foreign education: if you are using education completed in foreign colleges or universities to meet the qualification requirements, you must show that the education credentials have been evaluated by a private organization that specializes in interpretation of foreign education programs and such education has been deemed equivalent to that gained in an accredited u.s. education program; or full credit has been given for the courses at a u.s. accredited college or university.

summary

the assistant general counsel assists the secretary and general counsel and the associate general counsels, in the office of the secretary and general counsel (sg) at the national gallery of art (nga/gallery). this office is supervised by the secretary and general counsel, one of the six full-time executive officers selected by the board of trustees of the national gallery of art to manage the affairs of the gallery.

learn more about this agency

responsibilities

the office of the secretary and general counsel operates like a small legal partnership providing advice and other legal services to the rest of the gallery. in practice, the legal work is divided among the lawyers in the office. the assistant general counsel is involved in the drafting and negotiation of the many contracts entered into by the gallery that cannot be handled by a simple requisition form, concentrating on agreements for independent contractors and independent projects for the education department (including production agreements for software and cds and agreements with lecturers and  performers), the editors office (including book, production and distribution agreements and agreements with authors), the conservation department (including agreements with conservators and software developers); the center for the study of the visual arts (casva) (including agreements with visiting professors, fellows, contributing authors, and lecturers) and various other departments to enable the gallery to carry out its programmatic functions. the assistant general counsel has responsibility for reviewing immigration matters and overseeing the gallerys procurement of visas for foreign scholars; as well as researching matters relating to copyright and other intellectual property rights, taxation, wills and estates, commercial and residential leases, and other fields of law. the assistant general counsel also assists in review and drafting of internal gallery policies.

the paramount requirements for this position are a high degree of legal expertise, experience and good judgment. the unique nature of the legal status of the gallery enhances the complexity of problems that might appear less difficult in the case of an executive branch department or agency. the dual nature of the gallerys support and governances, trust and federal, requires great circumspection in developing legal positions or guidance as to action to be taken in various situations. absence of a large body of controlling precedent requires originality in developing sound positions and arguments.

if selected, you will:

1. draft a wide range of contracts, including agreements for conservators, educational consultants, performers, lecturers, translators and photographers.
2. advise on and review the gallery's applications for immunity from seizure for foreign works borrowed for special exhibitions.
3. research immigration law to ensure gallery compliance and oversee the gallery's procurement of visas for visiting foreign scholars.
4. advise the secretary to the board of trustees in researching governance issues and preparing for meetings.
5. advise gallery officers and employees as to their obligations and rights on all legal aspects of their official duties.
6. research and advise on issues concerning bequests, donations, trusts and estates and review pertinent documents.
7. research and advise on issues related to the gallery's retail and licensing operations.
8. research and advise on a variety of legal issues in the areas of copyright, administrative law, tax, new technologies, commercial and residential leases, torts, employment, and other areas as directed by the secretary and general counsel.

qualifications

basic requirements:
united states citizenship: non-citizens may only be appointed when it is not possible to recruit qualified citizens in accordance with va policy.
english language proficiency. ots must be proficient in spoken and written english in accordance with va handbook part ii, chapter 3, section a, paragraph 3j.
creditable experience
education:
graduation from a degree program in occupational therapy approved by the accreditation council for occupational therapy education (acote) or predecessor organizations to include an internship (supervised fieldwork experience required by the educational institution). the acote is the only accreditation agency recognized by the united states department of education (usde) and the council for higher education accreditation (chea). degree programs may be verified by contacting the american occupational therapy association website or at their office address: american occupational therapy association, p.o, box 31220, bethesda, md 20824-1220.
foreign graduates of occupational therapy programs meet the requirements subparagraph 2b(1) if they have a current, full, active and unrestricted license/certification/registration/trademark referred to in subparagraph 2d and certification/registration referred to in subparagraph 2c.
note: effective january 1, 2005, acote accredits only master or doctoral degree programs in occupational therapy.
certification/examination. possession of written documentation that the individual has passed the entry-level certification examination for ots which is administered by the national board for certification in occupational therapy (nbcot).
state licensure/certification/registration/trademark (hereafter referred to as state regulatory requirement).
the ot must hold a full, current, and unrestricted state license, certification, or registration or trademark to practice occupational therapy in a state, territory, a commonwealth of the united states (i.e., puerto rico), or in the district of columbia.
note: the ot must maintain full, current and unrestricted license, trademark, registration, or certification as required by state statute. the majority of states have determined that licensure is the most effective approach to regulating occupational therapy practitioners. as of the date of this standard, 47 states, the district of columbia, guam, and puerto rico license ots; two states-hawaii and michigan-have registration laws; and one state, colorado, has a title protection trademark law.
knowledge of occupational therapy practice: to be creditable, the experience must have required the use of knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics associated with current professional occupational therapy practice. creditable experience can be obtained through employment as an ot. this may be evidenced by one or both of the following:

federal agencies must provide reasonable accommodation to applicants with disabilities where appropriate. applicants requiring reasonable accommodation for any part of the application process should follow the instructions in the job opportunity announcement. for any part of the remaining hiring process, applicants should contact the hiring agency directly. determinations on requests for reasonable accommodation will be made on a case-by-case basis.

a reasonable accommodation is any change to a job, the work environment, or the way things are usually done that enables an individual with a disability to apply for a job, perform job duties or receive equal access to job benefits.

under the rehabilitation act of 1973, federal agencies must provide reasonable accommodations when:

* an applicant with a disability needs an accommodation to have an equal opportunity to apply for a job.
* an employee with a disability needs an accommodation to perform the essential job duties or to gain access to the workplace.
* an employee with a disability needs an accommodation to receive equal access to benefits, such as details, training, and office-sponsored events.

you can request a reasonable accommodation at any time during the application or hiring process or while on the job. requests are considered on a case-by-case basis.
