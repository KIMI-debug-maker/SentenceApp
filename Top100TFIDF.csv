executive summary

lavender youth recreation & information center (lyric), one of the oldest, largest, and most innovative organizations in the nation serving lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (lgbtqq) youth, seeks a strategic and **nimble** talent manager to lead the design and implementation of robust and versatile talent development systems, promote a supportive organizational culture that fosters mutual trust, creativity, cross-team learning, and drive an innovative approach to program refinement that transforms the systems that impact lgbtqq youth.

founded in 1988, lyric works to transform the landscape for all lgbtqq youth, particularly those who are low-income and youth of color, in schools, public agencies, and communities. with an anticipated budget of more than $3m and more than 25 staff members, 10 fellows and over 90 paid youth interns, the talent manager will join a passionate and **mission-driven** team in strengthening a network of supports for lgbtqq youth that includes direct advocacy, community-building opportunities, and workforce development initiatives. last year lyric impacted over 1,159 youth through direct services, and an additional 3,376 through outreach, in their efforts to build a youth leadership pipeline  strengthening the capacity of lgbtqq youth to develop key life skills, healthy relationships, and potential career pathways.

reporting to the deputy director and working closely with the leadership team, the talent manager will lead the design and implementation of lyrics talent development strategy, applying best practices from both human resources and key elements of youth development theory. as the primary coordinator for the organizations hiring, onboarding, and training program for youth development staff, the talent manager will steward lyrics organizational culture, leading evaluation, curriculum design, and systems that create efficiencies for program staff to more effectively do their work. the talent manager will conceive and facilitate both formal and informal learning opportunities, equipping staff in their ability to **adapt** and align programmatic work that collectively fulfills lyrics operating principles and mission.

the ideal candidate must share a passion for building the leadership capacity of lgbtqq youth, striving to foster a world that honors, respects and appreciates lgbtqq youth and their contributions. the successful talent manager will bring at least three years of professional experience in talent development, human resources and/or organizational development, preferably in a **mission-driven** context. this person will have demonstrated success in the design and implementation of learning systems across an organization, including the use of data-driven practices and direct facilitation of curricula or other learning resources within and across teams.

as a nationally-recognized model for leadership development with lgbtqq youth that is guided by its strategic initiatives and operating principles, lyric continues to innovate and drive **excellence** in its programming and internal culture and infrastructure, furthering its impact on the opportunities of lgbtqq young people.

the search is being conducted with assistance from allison kupfer poteet and makeba greene of the national search firm, npag. instructions for submitting applications, nominations, and inquiries can be found at the end of this document.

organizational overview

founded in 1988, lyric is an anchor institution where predominately low-income lgbtqq youth of color collaborate with peers and adult allies to promote social justice in their communities. combining advocacy efforts with a holistic set of services, lyric strives to transform the systems that marginalize lgbtqq youth, providing the supports they need to thrive.

in alignment with the organizations strategic plan, lyric envisions: (1) schools that are transformed into safe, inclusive environments where lgbtqq students can thrive, and (2) a comprehensive network of community supports to ensure successful progression into adulthood for transitional age lgbtqq youth. leadership and staff work toward this vision by uniting best practice with innovation to realize the organizational **excellence** needed to advance the field of lgbtqq youth development, and growing community support that reflects a high level of partner investment in lyrics mission, vision, and organizational sustainability.

lyrics continued growth is guided by its strategic initiatives and the following operating principles:

* learning: we bring curiosity, creativity, and fun to our work.
* sustainable impact: we commit to the long-term transformation of lives and institutions.
* leadership: we foster leadership to support a progressive movement that spans generations.
* allyship: we believe that everyone has a role in creating safe and thriving communities.
* social justice: we build upon a proud history of community self-determination by **challenging** institutionalized invisibility & inequity.

with an anticipated operating budget of more than $3m, lyric provides a robust network of supports for lgbtqq youth through three main avenues: youth advocacy, community building, and workforce development. with this approach, lyric weaves a safety net for lgbtqq youth, fostering systems change that is driven by young peoples leadership in advancing policy, engaging in direct advocacy, and spurring movement building within communities.

youth advocacy & case management

lyric provides a continuum of case management services at the individual level that build upon youths resiliency, providing access to mental and physical health services, jobs, educational counseling and enrollment, housing, budgeting, and basic needs, including support with legal name and gender marker change documentation. lyric provides these services free of charge, and this is often an entry point for young people who go on to engage further in the organizations efforts to build a leadership pipeline of lgbtqq young people.

community building & movement building

strengthening young peoples abilities at the interpersonal level, lyric also facilitates school and community-based programming to create collaborative learning environments where lgbtqq youth can build skills, identify allies, and develop a sense of family that enables them to be successful and truly thrive. by connecting lgbtqq youth leaders with other community efforts working for social justice, lyric also builds the power of lgbtqq young people in influencing and shaping policy and systems design and implementation.

workforce development

with an understanding of the barriers that many lgbtqq young people (particularly those who are low-income, undocumented and/or youth of color) face in gaining employment, lyric provides comprehensive workforce development services. youth ages 14-24 engage in a continuum of paid, work-based learning opportunities that build their leadership and life skills. this continuum includes one of lyrics newest programs, which is a two-year fellowship for transgender/gender non-conforming youth. in addition, lyric provides 1:1 support to youth job seekers (age 24 and younger). for many, lyric provides the first employment opportunity a young person has held, and a first step in building an income to support their future stability and career growth.

history and values

as one of the first and largest lgbtqq youth centers in the united states, lyric has impacted the landscape of services and supports that are available for lgbtqq youth, both regionally and nationally. the organization emerged from the shared vision of donna keiko ozawa and beth kivel, who sought to create a safe space and opportunity to build community for gay, lesbian, and bisexual youth. after the success of their first event  a community dance held in 1988  lyrics organizational goals, programming, and advocacy priorities began to take shape. in 1991, lyric achieved the first of many policy wins: receiving financial support from the city of san francisco for urgently-needed youth development programs that challenged homophobia and transphobia and educated community members about sexuality and gender. in direct response to the youth-led advocacy of lyric, mayor frank jordon signed a resolution to **prioritize** lgbtqq youth needs, including the establishment of a lgbtqq youth center in the castro.

in its transformation from a collective to a broader advocacy and service provider that is building a leadership pipeline of lgbtqq youth, lyric has become a small, but highly sophisticated leader in the delivery of youth development programming. lyrics peer-based approach to working with lgbtqq youth is a key element in their success, and the organization has been recognized by the community network for youth development (cnyd) for **excellence** in youth development outcomes and youth participant satisfaction.

opportunities and challenges for the talent manager

reporting to the deputy director and working closely with the leadership team, the talent manager will lead the design and implementation of lyrics talent development strategy while also serving as the primary coordinator for the organizations hiring, onboarding, and youth staff training. the talent manager will steward lyrics organizational culture, leading evaluation, curriculum design, and systems that create efficiencies for program staff to more effectively do their work. in the first 12-18 months and beyond, the talent manager can expect to engage in the following challenges and opportunities:

hours:full-time, monday - friday
the job in a nutshell:
one of the fundamental, and most critical(!), pieces of any great google shopping strategy is the product data feed. these feeds are the mechanisms of structured data that enable each shopping platform to take action i.e. sell our clients productsit needs to be done right! not only do different merchants have different requirements for feeds, these rules and requirements are continually changing, and any change unaccounted for can make or break profitability. clearly, this is a headache for the average marketer. but not for logical position! our e-commerce data feed specialists are shopping wizzes, helping our paid search team create new product feeds, optimizing existing feeds, and troubleshooting issues along the way. to keep up with our growing client-base, we are looking for the next teammate for our squad of e-commerce gurus. this role involves data (lots of data), interfacing and collaborating with operations team members, and being a source of knowledge for all things shopping.

-do you have a perfectly organized itunes library (not a single missing artist or album cover!)?
-are you learning obsessed? or obsessively curious?
-do you have a passion for digital marketing?
what you will love doing:
-creating static and dynamic data feeds that help clients optimize performance in online shopping channels
-reviewing existing feeds to gain product knowledge and information needed to organize a successful data feed file
-managing merchant center accounts for clients by ensuring all information about product specifications, pricing, and inventory are accurate and up to date
-analyzing overall performance and trends to troubleshoot data feed and work with the client to update campaigns or product information as needed
