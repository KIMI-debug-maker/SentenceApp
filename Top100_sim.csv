benefits:health/dental/vision + 401(k) + life + ltd insurance
hours:full-time, monday - friday
the job in a nutshell:
one of the fundamental, and most critical(!), pieces of any great google shopping strategy is the product data feed. these feeds are the mechanisms of structured data that enable each shopping platform to take action i.e. sell our clients productsit needs to be done right! not only do different merchants have different requirements for feeds, these rules and requirements are continually changing, and any change unaccounted for can make or break profitability. clearly, this is a headache for the average marketer. but not for logical position! our e-commerce data feed specialists are shopping wizzes, helping our paid search team create new product feeds, optimizing existing feeds, and troubleshooting issues along the way. to keep up with our growing client-base, we are looking for the next teammate for our squad of e-commerce gurus. this role involves data (lots of data), interfacing and collaborating with operations team members, and being a source of knowledge for all things shopping.
who is the perfect person for this team? if you answer yes to any of the following questions, we want to meet you!

-does improper formatting of any sort make your eye twitch (like that one, single tile pointing the wrong direction on the floor of the mexican restaurant down the street that you just cant seem to stop noticing..)?
-do you have a perfectly organized itunes library (not a single missing artist or album cover!)?
-are you learning obsessed? or obsessively curious?
-do you have a passion for digital marketing?
what you will love doing:
-creating static and dynamic data feeds that help clients optimize performance in online shopping channels
-reviewing existing feeds to gain product knowledge and information needed to organize a successful data feed file
-managing merchant center accounts for clients by ensuring all information about product specifications, pricing, and inventory are accurate and up to date
-analyzing overall performance and trends to troubleshoot data feed and work with the client to update campaigns or product information as needed
-staying aware of new trends in data feed optimization and industry best practices
-exercising discretion and independent judgment when handling matters of significance for the company or its clients
to fit the bill:
-bachelors degree preferred
-database experience preferred
-experience working with google merchant center and data feed creation preferred
-strong reading, writing, and communication skills
-creative, analytical, and driven individual with great attention to detail
-extremely motivated, **self-starter**
-extensive knowledge of microsoft office, particularly excelto score extra points:
-general coding knowledge: javascript, python, vba, etc.why you will love working here:

founded in 1988, lyric works to transform the landscape for all lgbtqq youth, particularly those who are low-income and youth of color, in schools, public agencies, and communities. with an anticipated budget of more than $3m and more than 25 staff members, 10 fellows and over 90 paid youth interns, the talent manager will join a passionate and **mission-driven** team in strengthening a network of supports for lgbtqq youth that includes direct advocacy, community-building opportunities, and workforce development initiatives. last year lyric impacted over 1,159 youth through direct services, and an additional 3,376 through outreach, in their efforts to build a youth leadership pipeline  strengthening the capacity of lgbtqq youth to develop key life skills, healthy relationships, and potential career pathways.

reporting to the deputy director and working closely with the leadership team, the talent manager will lead the design and implementation of lyrics talent development strategy, applying best practices from both human resources and key elements of youth development theory. as the primary coordinator for the organizations hiring, onboarding, and training program for youth development staff, the talent manager will steward lyrics organizational culture, leading evaluation, curriculum design, and systems that create efficiencies for program staff to more effectively do their work. the talent manager will conceive and facilitate both formal and informal learning opportunities, equipping staff in their ability to **adapt** and align programmatic work that collectively fulfills lyrics operating principles and mission.

the ideal candidate must share a passion for building the leadership capacity of lgbtqq youth, striving to foster a world that honors, respects and appreciates lgbtqq youth and their contributions. the successful talent manager will bring at least three years of professional experience in talent development, human resources and/or organizational development, preferably in a **mission-driven** context. this person will have demonstrated success in the design and implementation of learning systems across an organization, including the use of data-driven practices and direct facilitation of curricula or other learning resources within and across teams.

as a nationally-recognized model for leadership development with lgbtqq youth that is guided by its strategic initiatives and operating principles, lyric continues to innovate and drive **excellence** in its programming and internal culture and infrastructure, furthering its impact on the opportunities of lgbtqq young people.

the search is being conducted with assistance from allison kupfer poteet and makeba greene of the national search firm, npag. instructions for submitting applications, nominations, and inquiries can be found at the end of this document.

organizational overview

founded in 1988, lyric is an anchor institution where predominately low-income lgbtqq youth of color collaborate with peers and adult allies to promote social justice in their communities. combining advocacy efforts with a holistic set of services, lyric strives to transform the systems that marginalize lgbtqq youth, providing the supports they need to thrive.

in alignment with the organizations strategic plan, lyric envisions: (1) schools that are transformed into safe, inclusive environments where lgbtqq students can thrive, and (2) a comprehensive network of community supports to ensure successful progression into adulthood for transitional age lgbtqq youth. leadership and staff work toward this vision by uniting best practice with innovation to realize the organizational **excellence** needed to advance the field of lgbtqq youth development, and growing community support that reflects a high level of partner investment in lyrics mission, vision, and organizational sustainability.

lyrics continued growth is guided by its strategic initiatives and the following operating principles:

* learning: we bring curiosity, creativity, and fun to our work.
* sustainable impact: we commit to the long-term transformation of lives and institutions.
* leadership: we foster leadership to support a progressive movement that spans generations.
* allyship: we believe that everyone has a role in creating safe and thriving communities.
* social justice: we build upon a proud history of community self-determination by **challenging** institutionalized invisibility & inequity.

with an anticipated operating budget of more than $3m, lyric provides a robust network of supports for lgbtqq youth through three main avenues: youth advocacy, community building, and workforce development. with this approach, lyric weaves a safety net for lgbtqq youth, fostering systems change that is driven by young peoples leadership in advancing policy, engaging in direct advocacy, and spurring movement building within communities.

youth advocacy & case management

lyric provides a continuum of case management services at the individual level that build upon youths resiliency, providing access to mental and physical health services, jobs, educational counseling and enrollment, housing, budgeting, and basic needs, including support with legal name and gender marker change documentation. lyric provides these services free of charge, and this is often an entry point for young people who go on to engage further in the organizations efforts to build a leadership pipeline of lgbtqq young people.

community building & movement building

strengthening young peoples abilities at the interpersonal level, lyric also facilitates school and community-based programming to create collaborative learning environments where lgbtqq youth can build skills, identify allies, and develop a sense of family that enables them to be successful and truly thrive. by connecting lgbtqq youth leaders with other community efforts working for social justice, lyric also builds the power of lgbtqq young people in influencing and shaping policy and systems design and implementation.

workforce development

with an understanding of the barriers that many lgbtqq young people (particularly those who are low-income, undocumented and/or youth of color) face in gaining employment, lyric provides comprehensive workforce development services. youth ages 14-24 engage in a continuum of paid, work-based learning opportunities that build their leadership and life skills. this continuum includes one of lyrics newest programs, which is a two-year fellowship for transgender/gender non-conforming youth. in addition, lyric provides 1:1 support to youth job seekers (age 24 and younger). for many, lyric provides the first employment opportunity a young person has held, and a first step in building an income to support their future stability and career growth.

history and values

as one of the first and largest lgbtqq youth centers in the united states, lyric has impacted the landscape of services and supports that are available for lgbtqq youth, both regionally and nationally. the organization emerged from the shared vision of donna keiko ozawa and beth kivel, who sought to create a safe space and opportunity to build community for gay, lesbian, and bisexual youth. after the success of their first event  a community dance held in 1988  lyrics organizational goals, programming, and advocacy priorities began to take shape. in 1991, lyric achieved the first of many policy wins: receiving financial support from the city of san francisco for urgently-needed youth development programs that challenged homophobia and transphobia and educated community members about sexuality and gender. in direct response to the youth-led advocacy of lyric, mayor frank jordon signed a resolution to **prioritize** lgbtqq youth needs, including the establishment of a lgbtqq youth center in the castro.

in its transformation from a collective to a broader advocacy and service provider that is building a leadership pipeline of lgbtqq youth, lyric has become a small, but highly sophisticated leader in the delivery of youth development programming. lyrics peer-based approach to working with lgbtqq youth is a key element in their success, and the organization has been recognized by the community network for youth development (cnyd) for **excellence** in youth development outcomes and youth participant satisfaction.

jellyvision needs an am sales manager

we here at jellyvision are the proud parents of alex®, an interactive employee communications platform that happens to share some dna (and a sense of humor) with the smash-hit trivia video game you donâ??t know jack®, created by jellyvision's founder. alex makes navigating tricky decisionsâ??like choosing and using employee benefits or improving your financial wellnessâ??easier, faster, and more helpful, not to mention entertaining. the success of the alex platform has exceeded our wildest dreams, (except for the part right before we woke up where our mom was riding a giraffe), which is why we need talented folks like you to help us help alex take over the worldâ?¦erâ?¦continue to grow and succeed.

thatâ??s lovely, but whatâ??s the job?

jellyvision is looking to capitalize on the momentum that comes with disrupting an industry ripe for change and a big part of that is growing a team of account managers who are charged with delighting and growing current alex® accounts. the teamâ??s goal is to:

1. help customers be successful in their use of alex®
2. sell customers other alex® products and services that solve their problems
3. leverage strong customer relationships for marketing
4. effectively communicate customer insights to the broader team at jellyvision
5. ohâ?¦and be super fun and charming along the way.

as we expand our team, we need to add a management layer with a talent for coaching high performing, quota carrying account managers (ams) through a consultative enterprise saas sales process with a focus on increasing retention rates and promoting the sale of additional products. weâ??re looking for sharp, humble and highly motivated sales managers who will help our team efficiently and successfully scale. as a team, weâ??re a curious, goofy (but in a cool way), **hard-working** bunch who really like each other. it makes for a fun work day.

more specifically, as an am sales manager, youâ??d be responsible for:

managing performance and coaching your team.

*
* you will be responsible for the revenue goals and quota that falls within your team.
* youâ??ll meet with your account managers (a group of typically 7 to 10 people) one-on-one weekly to review their pipeline, discuss the â??healthâ? of their accounts, talk through the customer journey and their strategies, and identify clear and concise ways you can help support them to hit their goals.
* youâ??ll routinely shadow customer calls and hold feedback sessions with your account managers coaching them on ways to improve.
* along with the vice president of account management, youâ??ll participate in and lead team meetings.

hiring and training.

* weâ??re scaling and in a constant state of hiring for the account management team. in partnership with the vice president of account management, youâ??ll need to work to refine the account management role and job description. this includes (with the support of our hr team) identifying, sourcing, interviewing and hiring a new crop of ams.
* youâ??ll manage the onboarding process for all incoming account managers and help grow and optimize the training curriculum that gets ams ramped up quickly.

maintaining a close eye on team dynamics.

* youâ??ll help foster and enable a culture of collaboration, support, and fun.
* and, lead an environment of constant learning â?? about our industry, our customers, and how we can be most valuable.

close communication with the vp of account management.

* youâ??ll meet weekly with the vp of account management to review monthly forecasting, team wins and losses, individual performance as well as emerging healthcare industry trends identified through customer communications.

so what kind of folks are we looking for?

while weâ??re big believers that the right â??dnaâ? and cultural fit are what makes for a successful hire, weâ??ll take an early shine to candidates with the following background, skills, and experience:

proven management experience: ideally, 4+ years of experience successfully managing employees in an enterprise sales environment, preferably in the hr or saas sales space. weâ??re looking for managers who love to work with people, enjoy coaching and help foster growth and success in their direct reports.

successful track record working with enterprise customers on a revenue generating customer success team. our team is highly focused on net retention with renewals and aggressive revenue growth with upsell solutions while at the same time helping customers get the most value of their alex investment. we want someone whoâ??s seen success hitting quota with a similar account management experience.

superb listener: youâ??ll need to listen to your team to really understand how you can uniquely help each individual team member grow and reach their goals.

be curious: along with listening, we want you to generally be curious in what makes each of your account managers successful. whatâ??s their motivation for hitting goal? where do they want to see their career path take them? we want someone who knows how to develop that level of trust by remaining open, honest and transparent.

approachable and engaging: our am team is hungry for coaching and feedback that helps them be successful. whether itâ??s focusing on ways to improve their pitches or highlighting moments on calls when the individual could have dug deeper, the ams are looking for someone to tell it to them straight and help them develop a clear path to getting better.

confident, not cocky: we want you to lead confidently, but we also want you to be humble, thoughtful and genuine in your approach.

empowering: as you work with you team to plot out strategies and tactics, empower them to independently make the tough customer decisions they need to in order to successfully manage their book. give them your opinion, advice and feedback, but let them test and determine their own personal strategies knowing they have your support and back up when needed.

driven and motivated. weâ??re looking for **hardworking**, self-motivated folks who like to jump in and make an impact. itâ??s our grit and can-do (while at the same time delightfully fun and engaging) attitude that helps us win as a team.

collaborator. youâ??ll need to expertly navigate cross-team interactions. there will be times when youâ??ll need to listen and learn from your colleagues and peers. and on the flip side, there will be times when youâ??ll be responsible for proactively sharing ideas and helping evangelize customer success across the company. youâ??ll need to balance the two and determine the best way to productively interact and communicate with your colleagues.

be a student. on our team, everyone is encouraged to be a student of customer success, the healthcare industry and the benefits world. proactively research and find blogs, data, articles, and content that will help you and the team become smarter benefits consultants. youâ??ll also need to patiently learn our current processes, dive into our customer journey and playbook, and help identify areas we can grow and improve.

anything else?â  we share a commitment to **excellence** and a desire to work in a comfortable, friendly atmosphere, so we only hire nice, bright, funny people who are willing to work hard.â  our credo is a simple one: be helpful. and we think we can be most helpful if our workforce is as diverse in thought, perspective, and culture as the people who use our products. we are looking to add amazing folks to our team who will bring diversity across many lines, including race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, age, marital status, disability, gender identity, sex, and country of origin.

are there any perks?â yes, we love perks.

* competitive pay, 401(k) with matching and benefits.â we pay 100% of the cost of premiums for medical, dental, vision, disability and life insurance for our employees (as long as you qualify for our tobacco-free discount; if youâ??re a tobacco user, your medical premiums will be higher than $0). we also cover a really nice chunk of the cost of premiums for spouse/dependent medical, dental and vision insurance.
* casual dress and a flexible schedule. come in a sweatshirt, jeans, whatever, like everyone else here.
* creative work environment. we are lucky to work in a place that is full of intelligent, talented and innovative folks. although most hours the place is deathly quiet (we're a focused bunch), this is punctuated with hilarious outbursts and general merriment, which makes a nice way to spend the day.
* free food. every week, we stock our kitchen with free healthy snack foods, and we have a catered lunch every other week to give people a reason to hang out and eat together.
* easy transportation and lots of love for folks who bike to work. weâ??re really close to the north/clybourn red line stop and the halsted (#8) bus (right by the apple store and mega whole foods too), and we have a transit fsa that allows you to dedicate pre-tax dollars to public transportation expenses. a number of our employees like to bike to work, so we also have bike storage, showers and lockers in the office.â  and for those without their own bike in the city, we offer free divvy memberships â?? complete with jellyvision bike helmets you can borrow from the office.
* did we mention our yoga and meditation classes? we bring a pro instructor right to the office. fully subsidized by jellyvision and fully optional, btw.
* oh! and we have a massage chair. not just any massage chair, my friend. itâ??s the renew 2 zero-gravity massage chair by brookstone®. feeling a little stiff? sit down. relax. feel better? good. okay, back to work.

and how do i apply?

* we look forward to hearing about you and what you do. make sure your application includes:aâ cover letterâ that highlights three reasons you think youâ??d be great for the gig, focusing on how your past experience has prepared you for this kind of position. writing is key to all we do, and we weigh cover letters heavily.â  we love a cover letter that really shows us your personality (check out our company bios to see the wide range of personalities weâ??ve already got in house), but donâ??t stress if youâ??re not a comedian. you donâ??t have to be funny. just be yourself. weâ??re mostly interested in learning who you are, what you love to do, and why youâ??d love to do it here with us.

please note our current opportunities below.

*

were nerdily passionate about creating awesome docs of all sorts for our customers, from ui text to walkthroughs, from online help to trailhead modules, from release notes to developer guides, and from videos to implementation guides.

you have the flexibility and openness to adopt our nbsp;style, processes, and practices, but arent afraid to suggest improvements that benefits our writers, our collaborators, or our customers.

you love writing for different audiences, from end users to admins to developers. you may have your favorite kind of user, but you can write content that will be engaging and informative for anyone.

*

you know how to gracefully accept feedback. many folks across salesforce have strong opinions about the experience we present to customers. youll need to know when to push back on feedback you disagree with and when to adopt.

wed love it if you can write nbsp;about ai and machine-learning-based applications, and/or know the tools, technologies, and practices we use on the doc team, such as:

the agile approach to development.

"customer service/office manager superhero
lifeonaire - durham, nc
$15 - $18 an hour - part-time

are you passionate about people?

want your work to be meaningful?

enjoy **problem-solving** and overcoming challenges?

then you might be the exact person were looking for.

hi, im jason wojo, ceo of a company called lifeonaire and im looking for a caring, energetic, loyal, smart person to join our company in a very important role - providing world-class service to our customers while also holding down the fort (running the back end of the business).

maybe this person is you.

lifeonaire is a christian-based life and business coaching organization dedicated to helping people live truly abundant and prosperous lives. think of it this way...a millionaire is someone who has a lot of money; a lifeonaireis someone who has something much more valuable...a lot of life. many have achieved great wealth, but few with great wealth have achieved great lives.

feel free to check out our websitefor more info on who we are.

our coaching students and customers mean the world to us and due to our recent growth, we need a dedicated customer success superhero (i.e. super-duper-awesome customer service rockstar) who is determined, passionate, and ready to save the world from poor customer service experiences. but theres more...this person also needs to be awesome at and love running the administrative and operational side of our business. theres a lot that goes on behind the scenes that youll be running and in charge of with my oversight and guidance.

who our hero will be:

our hero will work from home (remotely) for the most part and will have a critical role on our success team. s/he will work one-on-one with our customers to answer questions, proactively solve problems, and do everything possible to help them succeed and have a fantastic experience with lifeonaire. they will also handle billing, process orders, do a small amount of bookkeeping, help us organize better, etc.

what specific superpowers are we looking for?

* youre naturally a people person. you love dealing with and interacting with all kinds of people. you come across as sincere, warm, genuine, and caring. empathy is kinda your middle name (maybe literally).
* you thrive working remotely on your own.you excel at working offsite and are excellent at being able to control, manage, and monitor your work environment, workload, time, and productivity.
* youre **proactive** and **self-reliant**. you are outstanding at following directions but also can think on your own and fill in the blanks when theyre missing. you dont need super-specific details for every single little thing or need a lot of hand-holding.
* youre emotionally mature.you dont get frazzled, defensive, easily overwhelmed, or take it personally when faced with adversity, deadlines, or conflict, and can naturally help others overcome these emotions when theyre experiencing them.
* youre an action taker and a strong finisher. youre a **self-starter** and great at following-up and following-through to the very end of a project or task without needing someone to check in, micromanage, or look over your shoulder.
* youre conscientious and detail-oriented. you take great pride in your work and want things done right. you appreciate the details and process and you dont cut corners to sacrifice quality. you already found 5 spelling or grammar errors in this posting.
* youre a can do problem solver and love helping others.youre great at getting out in front of problems and enjoy proactively helping customers with issues and challenges whenever (or ideally before) they arise.
* you love life and smile a lot!youre a genuinely happy person and it shows in everything you do. youre fun, energetic, positive, and optimistic and love sharing that joy with others.
* you want to be part of something bigger than yourself.this isnt just about helping customers - its about changing lives. that may sound corny or an exaggeration but its true. we want someone who cares deeply about our mission and recognizes and the importance of their role in what we do as a company.

still with me? cool...theres still a bit more. in addition to everything listed above (because that wasnt enough right?), you should:

* be fairly tech savvy with computers, the internet, and using software in general. were not expecting you to be a developer or programmer, but you should be pretty good with excel, word, etc. and be a wizard at finding answers online.
* have super-high integrity and a track-record of being honest, dedicated, and loyal.
* be extremely organized (almost anal) and pay close attention to details. we have to make sure things dont fall through the cracks due to neglect or disorganization.
* be flexible, able to **adapt**, and learn new things quickly. we are constantly evolving, improving, and finding better ways to do things. we need someone who can keep up and embraces the changes at a minimum, or even better initiate changes.
* be responsive, reliable, and trustworthy. since youre not working in an office, theres a high level of responsibility required.
* have great interpersonal skills and a knack for making people feel understood and cared for.

what will you be doing?

your position responsibilities are two-fold...

in the customer success role, our hero will be working from home and communicating regularly one-on-one with our customers to make sure that their experience with lifeonaire is world class. youll be answering questions, proactively solving problems, and helping them succeed in their journey with us as a company.

some of these duties will be reactive where you might be responding to emails, phone calls, etc., while others will be **proactive**, like writing customer thank you notes for example, or making welcome calls to new customers.

because our customer success superhero is likely to have both the first significant contact and the most frequent ongoing communication with our customers, its crucial that you leave a phenomenal impression at every single encounter.

so in other words, were looking for someone thats kind of a customer support champion and not just a boring, eking-through-life, do-the-bare-minimum customer service zombie that mopes around at the dmv, but instead someone that loves to go the extra mile (or two) to give our customers a great big wow! experience at every corner.

in the office manager role, youll be the glue that keeps the program together and moving forward. youll be coordinating our coaching program live call schedule, scheduling and sending out emails in our autoresponder, working with our suppliers and vendors, managing our online store, coordinating live event logistics, handling payroll and billing, managing our crm and database, maybe even do a little bit of bookkeeping.

hours and pay

this position requires around 15-20 hours per week, mon-fri. specific hours can be flexible, but should be able to be consistent. we can work with you depending on your circumstances. we can add hours later if need be, once youve shown efficiency and effectiveness with the hours given. salary depends on awesomeness and experience and starts in the $15-18/hr range.

who shouldnt apply

kryptonite deal-breakers for our superhero are things like:

* having a debbie downer attitude
* being intolerant, judgemental, or impatient with others
* gossiping, arrogance, dishonesty, laziness, and/or questionable integrity
* not accepting responsibility for your own actions
* youre only looking for a paycheck

lastly...

we have an absolute blast at what we do and we believe in (and live!) what we teach. we work hard, play hard, and live by a set of values and standards that makes our company a fantastic place to learn, grow, contribute, and find fulfillment.

* if these sound good, then take the next step and apply.
* if not, no hard feelings at all. we realize this position is only for the right person.

heres how to apply

heres the first steps in your application:

* write us a cover letter addressing the following:
* why you think youre the person for this position. if you dont have any relevant experience, thats ok, but then tell us what makes you think youd be great at this?
* what would this position have to pay to make it worth your while? why?
* describe your current or most recent position - what did you do and what did you like and not like?
* if you dont have a job, explain why. if you do have one, explain why youre looking elsewhere.
* whats the hardest youve ever worked on something in your life? what was the result?
* what are the last 3 books youve read?
* what do you do for fun?
* send us a recent resume
* submit 3 references with full contact information
* 1 personal
* 1 professional
* 1 family

send both the cover letter and resume in pdf format only to opportunities at lifeonaire.com. oh...and when you send the email, please include a cute smiley face in the subject line of your email, like this : -) this is your first test to see if you are good at following simple directions and whether or not you even read this entire posting.

(yes there are some hoops to jump through here with the application. i get it. and theres more after these initial steps. but we want the right people on the bus because this bus is going very cool places.)

we look forward to hearing from you!

"director of commercial lending

fairway america, llc in portland, or usa

be the leader of our new lending division!

director of commercial lending

as the ceo and chief investment officer of fairway america, i am looking for a talented, **ambitious**, and dedicated commercial real estate lending professional to head the new commercial lending division of our company. in the last five years, fairway america has rapidly become the industry leader in the small balance real estate (sbre) space through our discretionary investment funds, our equity capital raising platform for sbre entrepreneurs, sbre advisory and consulting services, and our back-end fund administration and accounting services. this unique market positioning now provides us with an opportunity to expand our business offerings to include a commercial real estate loan origination mortgage banking piece to round out the product mix available to our sbre entrepreneur clients. therefore, i am looking for a talented and high-achieving commercial loan professional to head up this division.

the role will require someone with a strong background in commercial lending who can navigate the complete process of connecting worthy sbre entrepreneurs with the right lender for their deal. the successful candidate will understand and have the ability to communicate the true value that a commercial real estate loan broker can offer them, have an intimate knowledge of the intricacies of the lending process, and will have (or can quickly create) solid relationships with numerous lenders with a broad range of debt products.

are you at the stage of your life where you are ready for that prime occasion to step up to what might be the best opportunity and greatest **challenge** of your career? if you have an entrepreneurial spirit, are serious about helping people make the right connections to close deals and will only be satisfied when you succeed (and earn a great income in the process), we want to hear from you!

--matthew burk, ceo/cio, fairway america

at fairway america, we are truly committed to living and operating by our core values. these values are alive at our company and we live them every day while pursuing our mission of facilitating a massive flow of capital to worth sbre entrepreneurs.

we have an excellent track record to date of achieving that mission and have become the industry leader in the sbre space. we have experienced significant growth in our platform over the last few years, and have an excellent combination of seasoned company veterans and top talent newcomers to service our clients. as we are always on the look-out for ways to make the deal process easier for our sbre entrepreneurs clients, we have a determined that adding a commercial lending/brokerage arm to our suite of services would help them and us streamline the process of closing deals. most of our clients deals require senior financing of some type (ranging from construction and bridge to fully amortizing permanent financing and everything in between). since they are already using us to invest in the equity, raise equity capital, help them create their offering, and/or administer and manage the syndication on the back end, procuring market based senior debt is a natural addition. we enjoy a strong industry presence, have a long list of clients and potential clients in the wings, and a cadre of in-house resources to support this loan brokerage work, including processing, underwriting, closing and servicing. now, we need the right person lead this commercial lending division. is that person you?

* do you have a strong commercial lending background with a proven track record of connecting clients with the right lending source for their deal?

* do you have a deep grasp of the current real estate and debt financing markets and regularly keep apprised of changes and fluctuations?

* have you established and maintained positive and effective working relationships with industry lenders?

* are you a talented and capable real estate-based financial professional who understands intimately how to negotiate deals?

* do you have a deep understanding of lending documents, an ability to see the implications of the details line by line but are also able to grasp the complete deal as a whole and explain it clearly to the client?

* are you unafraid of being in the spotlight but rather relish the idea of having your **results** highly visible for all to see?

* can you lead, influence, persuade and guide other people to make intelligent choices that are in their own best interest?

* are you a capable executive-level real estate professional who has been preparing yourself for the opportunity of a lifetime?

* are you unafraid of hard work, deep commitment and high achievement (and in fact relish it)?

* do you get excited about your work, take deep pride in doing it well, and think about it even when you are not working?

* can you make tough decisions and stand behind them?

* do you prefer contributing to the success of a smaller, tight-knit, entrepreneurial team as opposed to working in a gigantic corporate environment?

* does doing your absolute best and being an **achiever** in whatever you do come naturally to you?
